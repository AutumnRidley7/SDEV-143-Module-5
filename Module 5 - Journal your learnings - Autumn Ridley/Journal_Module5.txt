Module 5 Journal - Reflections on Modules 4 & 5

Methodology:
I chose a typed format for ease of editing and clarity. This allows me to quickly revise and reference my notes.

Key Learnings:
- Pull requests are critical for collaborative workflow.
- Merge conflicts are normal and require careful resolution.
- Branch management is essential to prevent overwriting others’ work.

Challenges:
- Understanding rebase conflicts took some trial and error.
- Remembering to stage resolved files before continuing a rebase was tricky at first.

Future Reference:
- Always check the branch before pushing.
- Keep a folder for assignment documentation to stay organized.
